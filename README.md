This repo does not contain any useful app. It's just a bunch of structures and algorithms.

## A bunch of things to do
- [ ] Keep main simple, and import files?
- [ ] Use comptime to generate a bunch of nodes with values instead of doing manually. How to name variables at comptime?
- [ ] Use funnctions to create linked lists and trees, focus on algorithms
